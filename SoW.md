# Börsibaar 2.0 SaaS

## High-level description

<!-- What is this project about? Please give 3-5 sentence CEO-level description of the project. -->

Börsibaar 2.0 is the transformation of a specialized bar management system into a multi-tenant Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform. The platform enables any bar or event organizer to implement a "stock market" themed pricing model where drink prices fluctuate based on real-time demand. The project focuses on decoupling the existing TalTech-specific logic to support global onboarding, subscription-based billing, and isolated data management for multiple organizations. With improvements to our existing features and new features like market crashes and a SEO optimized home page for marketing.

## Business value

<!-- What is the business value of this project? Why this project is important? Who and how will benefit from this project? What is the estimated impact? -->

Transforming the project to SaaS unlocks several revenue streams and operational efficiencies

1. **Market Expansion:** Moves the product from a single use tool to a marketable product for the global events industry.
2. **Monetization:** Introduces recurring revenue through a hybrid pricing model (monthly subscription or percentage based transaction fees)
3. **Scalability**: Automates the onboarding process, allowing the business to grow without manual database provisioning for new clients.
4. **Data Insights**: Provides aggregated (anonymous) data on beverage trends across multiple venues, increasing the platforms long term value. ?Maybe a separate premium feature?
